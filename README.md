## Projects for Term 1

### Fish and Ships
10/22/25



My very first game code- based off of the classic asteroid shooter game. 
Navigate through coral pieces in a fish shaped spaceship to survive for as long as possible. Shoot drops of water to destroy the oncoming coral. Pick up powerups to regenerate the ship's health and ammo. 

Have fun and don't get hit!

### Castle Corridors
12/15/25


A group project with peers. Run through a maze and avoid the bees flying around in the corridors. Try to escape before the king gets to you! Press space to attack and run into the lightning bolts to gain powerups. 

Don't get caught!
